# datasci_3_eda
This is assignment 3 for HHA 507. 



Identify outliers in your dataset using the IQR method or visualization tools.
Decide on an approach to handle these outliers (e.g., remove, replace, or retain) and justify your decision in a markdown cell.
If there are no outliers based on 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations (or z scores >= 1), please state that and support it with your code.
